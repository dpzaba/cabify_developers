#### Entity

The journey resource accepts and responds with [Journey](#entities/journey) entities.

#### Purpose



#### Methods

There are two ways of creating a new journey:

 * `GET` - requires `:id` parameter.
 * `POST` - create and start a new journey that will be assigned an ID by the server.
 * `PUT` - create and start a new journey with a uuid generated by the client in the path.

When possible, we always recommend trying to create a journey using the `PUT` method with a uuid generated by the client. If for some reason when creating a journey the server receives the request but the client does not receive a response, the journey can be re-requested with the same uuid and the server will respond with the original journey instead of creating a duplicate. This is especially useful in dealing with poor networks connections, such as when connected using 3G.

#### Access

Only logged in users will be allowed to request a journey. The owner will always be taken from the currently logged in user, but journeys can be requested for _anonymous_ riders and other riders with a user in the same account.
